Things to fix for this presentation:

- need to include a GWAS example (maybe pose a big problema nd talk about how it can be solved with bioinf)
- more health data examples
-spent so long getting one human genome, and now we have 1000s which leads to lots of SNPs, then we can use these in GWAS studies!
- for mauve, start with a simple example and problem and then how we can solve it
- could talk about sequencing tumours
- could ask who finds cancer interesting, who finds all this other stuff interesting, and then say how they should think bioinf is interesting bc that is the only way we will get to look at all that data and solve these problems
- think about making everything a question that can then only be solved with bioinf
- look up galixy programs (maybe as an example instead of mauve?)
- what did you find and why is it important
- flashier examples, human health, to make it more interesting, or on topics they like/find "cool"
- remove command line stuff :( 
- for mauve example, maybe talk about how bacteria have genes shuffled around and we wantt to look at anitbiotic resistance and how we want to see what genes are where and similar between different bacteria
- will have to make simple pictures of Mauve example to show it on a small scale and then large scale
- add in slide that has control and cases for GWAS study



Things to mention when speaking:
- math bio program
- scale of genomes (human is this big, bacteria is this big)
- I aquired these skills though my fourth year thesis (not "i didnt know anything")
- its fun!
- 1000 genomes project resulted in ONE paper! not 1000
- be super aware of my language and that I am only using positive words, never putting anything bioinf down
